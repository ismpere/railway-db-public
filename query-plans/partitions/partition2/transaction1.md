# Prerequisites

## Getting the connection

```sql
Query Text: 
			SELECT connection_id FROM schedule WHERE route = (
				SELECT route_id FROM routes
				WHERE start_station = (
					SELECT station_id
					FROM stations
					WHERE name = $1
				)
				AND end_station = (
					SELECT station_id
					FROM stations
					WHERE name = $2
				)
			)
			AND start_time = $3
			AND train = $4
		
	Seq Scan on schedule  (cost=1223.62..1767.59 rows=1 width=4)
	  Filter: ((route = $2) AND (start_time = $3) AND ((train)::text = ($4)::text))
	  InitPlan 3 (returns $2)
	    ->  Seq Scan on routes  (cost=805.17..1223.62 rows=1 width=4)
	          Filter: ((start_station = $0) AND (end_station = $1))
	          InitPlan 1 (returns $0)
	            ->  Seq Scan on stations  (cost=0.00..402.59 rows=1 width=4)
	                  Filter: ((name)::text = ($1)::text)

	                  Filter: ((name)::text = ($2)::text)
```

## Getting the seats

```sql
Query Text: (
					SELECT seat_id
					FROM seats
					JOIN wagons ON wagon = wagon_id
					JOIN trains ON wagons.train = train_id
					JOIN schedule ON schedule.train = train_id
					WHERE connection_id = $1

```

### For every seat:

##### Checking whether occupied	                    

```sql
Query Text: SELECT (
			SELECT COUNT(*) FROM passengers_schedule WHERE seat = $1 AND connection = $2
		) > 0
	Result  (cost=399.26..399.27 rows=1 width=1)
	  InitPlan 1 (returns $0)
	    ->  Aggregate  (cost=399.25..399.26 rows=1 width=8)
	          ->  Seq Scan on passengers_schedule  (cost=0.00..399.25 rows=1 width=0)
	                Filter: ((seat = 371426) AND (connection = 1))
```
	                
## Cross joining passengers with connection and their seat, for every passenger:

```sql
	Query Text: SELECT 1 FROM ONLY "public"."seats_unpartitioned" x WHERE "seat_id" OPERATOR(pg_catalog.=) $1 FOR KEY SHARE OF x
	LockRows  (cost=0.42..8.45 rows=1 width=10)
	  ->  Index Scan using seats_pkey on seats_unpartitioned x  (cost=0.42..8.44 rows=1 width=10)
	        Index Cond: (seat_id = 371426)

	Query Text: SELECT 1 FROM ONLY "public"."schedule" x WHERE "connection_id" OPERATOR(pg_catalog.=) $1 FOR KEY SHARE OF x
	LockRows  (cost=0.29..8.31 rows=1 width=10)
	  ->  Index Scan using schedule_pkey on schedule x  (cost=0.29..8.30 rows=1 width=10)
	        Index Cond: (connection_id = 1)

	Query Text: SELECT 1 FROM ONLY "public"."passengers" x WHERE "passenger_id" OPERATOR(pg_catalog.=) $1 FOR KEY SHARE OF x
	LockRows  (cost=0.29..8.31 rows=1 width=10)
	  ->  Index Scan using passengers_pkey on passengers x  (cost=0.29..8.30 rows=1 width=10)
	        Index Cond: (passenger_id = 1)
```
